name: "\U0001F680 Request feature"
about: "Use this template if you have a suggestion (and may want get it implemented \U0001F642)."

---

**Please describe in detail what you would like to solve with the proposed feature:**

<!--
Example 1: When I click a close button of the Nuvola window, music stops playing and Nuvola quits.
I'd prefer Nuvola to keep playing in the background instead.
-->

<!--
Example 2: I use Pomodoro technique to organize work time and I'm listening to Deep Focus playlist when I'm working.
I'd like Nuvola to stop playing when a work period (25 minute) ends and resume playback
when a new work period starts after a break (5 or 15 minutes).

**Do you have an idea how it could be solved and how it should look like?**

<!--
Example 1: Please add new settings "Run in background when the window is closed" with three options:
"Always"/"When music is playing (default)"/"Never".
-->

<!--
Example 2: Please add a Pomodoro feature that stops/resumes music playback as described above.
Add a button to the title bar of the main window to activate the functionality.
Add a timer showing the remaining time next to the button.
These options should be configurable: The length of the work interval, the length of the short break,
the length of the long break, the number of work intervals before a long break.
