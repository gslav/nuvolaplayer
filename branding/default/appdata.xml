  <summary>Tight integration of web-based media streaming services with your desktop.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      @FULL_NAME@ provides a tight Linux desktop integration for web-based media streaming services such as Spotify,
      YouTube Music, Apple Music and others. The goal is to achieve more native user experience and tighter integration
       with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer. It tries to feel and look like a native
       application as much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Features: desktop launchers, integration with media applets (e.g. in GNOME Shell and Ubuntu sound menu),
      Unity launcher quick list actions, lyrics fetching, Last.fm audio scrobbler, tray icon, desktop notifications,
      media keys binding, password manager, remote control over HTTP and more. Some features may be not be available
      because of missing dependencies or were disabled by your distributor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Support: Users of third-party build should contact the customer care of their distributor.
